### License and Attribution

Created on 6 July 2020 for Hear Ye backend developers.
This repository is also designed to be a safe place
to download bulk data from the GitHub API as a reliable
source  rather than the govtrack or govinfo websites.

This data was gathered from the congress.gov website
using the [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress)
repository (we technically use a port at
[Hear-Ye/congress](https://github.com/Hear-Ye/congress))

The data of this project itself is licensed under
the CC0 1.0 Universal license (which can be found in
the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file), and the underlying 
source code used to update the data is licensed under
the Apache 2.0 license (which can be found in the
